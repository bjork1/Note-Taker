# Unit 11 Express Homework: Note Taker

## Description

This application can be used to write, save, and delete notes. The application will use an express backend and save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

The project uses HTML routes, using GET and POST, to retrieve note information, which is stored in the db.JSON file. On the HTML, a new note is returned to the page.

The web page is run by entering "server.js" into the terminal.

This is the USER story:

## User Story

I WANT to be able to delete notes I've written before

SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete

## Business Context

For users that need to keep track of a lot of information, it's easy to forget or be unable to recall something important. Being able to take persistent notes allows users to have written information available when needed.
